| Comma-separated values (CSVs)              | Delimited text files where the delimiter is a comma. Used to store structured data.                                                                                                                            |
| Delimited text file formats                | Text files are used to store data where each line or row has values separated by a delimiter. A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters specifying the boundary between values. Common delimiters include comma, tab, colon, vertical bar, and space. |
| NoSQL databases                            | Databases are designed to store and manage unstructured data and provide analysis tools for examining this type of data.                                                                                       |
| Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems | Systems that focus on handling business transactions and storing structured data.                                                                                                                               |
| Relational databases                       | Databases are designed to store structured data with well-defined schemas and support standard data analysis methods and tools.                                                                                |
| Sensors                                    | Devices such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags generate structured data.                                                                                      |
| Spreadsheets                               | Software applications like Excel and Google Spreadsheets are used for organizing and analyzing structured data.                                                                                                |
| SQL Databases                              | Databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data in structured formats.                                                                                        |
| Tab-separated values (TSVs)                | Delimited text files where the delimiter is a tab. Used as an alternative to CSV when literal commas are present in text data.                                                                                |
