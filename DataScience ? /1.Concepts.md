At the end of the day, for businesses, they know one thing, that if they are unable to measure something, they are unable to improve it. And if they are unable to measure their costs, they are unable to reduce them. If they're unable to measure their profits, they are unable to increase them. So the first thing a company has to do is to start recording information, start capturing data, data about costs. And the differentiate it by labor costs and material cost, the cost to how much it cost to sell one product and the total cost , heres come **DataScience** 

# Data science 
Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

# What Do Data Scientists Do? 

There are many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve math, programming, and curiosity about data.

New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.

Knowledgeable data scientists are in high demand. Jobs in data science pays high salaries for skilled workers.

The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.

Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data.â€¯

Some key data science related terms you learned in this lesson include: outliers, model, algorithms, JSON, XML. CSV, and regression.
