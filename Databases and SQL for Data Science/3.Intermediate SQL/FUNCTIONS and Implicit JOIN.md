# SQL Cheat Sheet: Functions and Implicit JOIN

| Command | Syntax (MySQL/DB2) | Description | Example (MySQL/DB2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **COUNT** | `SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;` | `COUNT` function returns the number of rows that match a specified criterion. | `SELECT COUNT(emp_id) FROM employees;` |
| **AVG** | `SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;` | `AVG` function returns the average value of a numeric column. | `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **SUM** | `SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;` | `SUM` function returns the total sum of a numeric column. | `SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **MIN** | `SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;` | `MIN` function returns the smallest value of the selected column. | `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **MAX** | `SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;` | `MAX` function returns the largest value of the selected column. | `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **ROUND** | `SELECT ROUND(number, decimals, operation) AS RoundValue;` | `ROUND` function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places. | `SELECT ROUND(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **LENGTH** | `SELECT LENGTH(column_name) FROM table;` | `LENGTH` function returns the length of a string (in bytes). | `SELECT LENGTH(f_name) FROM employees;` |
| **UCASE** | `SELECT UCASE(column_name) FROM table;` | `UCASE` function displays the column name in each table in uppercase. | `SELECT UCASE(f_name) FROM employees;` |
| **LCASE** | `SELECT LCASE(column_name) FROM table;` | `LCASE` function displays the column name in each table in lowercase. | `SELECT LCASE(f_name) FROM employees;` |
| **DISTINCT** | `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table;` | `DISTINCT` function is used to display data without duplicates. | `SELECT DISTINCT UCASE(f_name) FROM employees;` |
| **DAY** | `SELECT DAY(column_name) FROM table;` | `DAY` function returns the day of the month for a given date. | `SELECT DAY(hire_date) FROM employees WHERE emp_id = '10001';` |
| **CURRENT_DATE** | `SELECT CURRENT_DATE;` | `CURRENT_DATE` is used to display the current date. | `SELECT CURRENT_DATE;` |
| **DATEDIFF()** | `SELECT DATEDIFF(date1, date2);` | `DATEDIFF()` is used to calculate the difference between two dates or time stamps. The default value generated is the difference in number of days. | `SELECT DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date) FROM table;` |
| **FROM_DAYS()** | `SELECT FROM_DAYS(number_of_days);` | `FROM_DAYS()` is used to convert a given number of days to YYYY-MM-DD format. | `SELECT FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date)) FROM table;` |
| **DATE_ADD()** | `SELECT DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL n type);` | `DATE_ADD()` is used to calculate the date after or before mentioned number of units of date type, i.e. if `n` is `+ve` and `type=DAY`, the result is `n` days after what is mentioned in date column. The type variable can also be months or years. | `SELECT DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL 3 DAY);` |
| **DATE_SUB()** | `SELECT DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL n type);` | `DATE_SUB()` is used to calculate the date prior to a given date by a mentioned number of units of date type, i.e. if `n` is `+ve` and `type=DAY`, the result is `n` days before what is mentioned in date column. The type variable can also be months or years. | `SELECT DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL 3 DAY);` |
| **Subquery** | `SELECT column_name, [...] FROM table_name WHERE [...] WHERE column_name operator (SELECT column_name [...] FROM table [...] WHERE [...]);` | A subquery is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the `WHERE` clause. Subquery is used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved. | `SELECT emp_id, f_name, l_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);` <br> `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_id, f_name, l_name, job_id IN (SELECT job_ident FROM jobs);` |
| **Implicit Inner Join** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name;` | Implicit Inner Join combines two or more records but displays only matching values in both tables. Inner join applies only two specified columns. | `SELECT * FROM employees, jobs WHERE employees.job_id = jobs.job_ident;` |
| **Implicit Cross Join** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1, table2;` | Implicit Cross Join is defined as a Cartesian product where the number of rows in the first table is multiplied by the number of rows in the second table. | `SELECT * FROM employees, jobs;` |
