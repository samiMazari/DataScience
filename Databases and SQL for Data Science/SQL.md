# SQL Cheat Sheet: Intermediate - LIKE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY

| Command | Syntax (MySQL/DB2) | Description | Example (MySQL/DB2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LIKE** | `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;` | `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. Two wildcards often used in conjunction with the `LIKE` operator are percent sign (%) and underscore sign (_), depending upon the SQL engine being used. | `SELECT f_name, l_name FROM employees WHERE address LIKE "Elgin_IL%";` <br> This command will output all entries with `Elgin_IL` in the address. |
| **BETWEEN** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;` | The `BETWEEN` operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates. The `BETWEEN` operator is inclusive, begin and end values are included. | `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;` <br> This generates all records of employees with salaries between 40000 and 80000. |
| **ORDER BY** | `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC/DESC;` | `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. The default is ascending. In case of multiple columns in `ORDER BY`, the sorting will be done in the sequence of the appearance of the arguments. | `SELECT f_name, l_name, dep_id FROM employees ORDER BY dep_id DESC, l_name;` <br> This displays the first name, last name, and department id of employees, first sorted in descending order of department IDs and then sorted alphabetically as per their last names. |
| **GROUP BY** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name(s);` | `GROUP BY` clause is used in collaboration with the `SELECT` statement to arrange data with identical values into groups. | `SELECT dep_id, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY dep_id;` <br> This returns the department IDs and the number of employees in them, grouped by the department IDs. |
| **HAVING** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition;` | `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with `GROUP BY` clause in collaboration with the `SELECT` statement in order to filter the data as per the given condition and then group as per identical values of a specified parameter. | `SELECT dep_id, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY" FROM EMPLOYEES GROUP BY DEP_ID HAVING COUNT(*) < 4 ORDER BY AVG_SALARY;` |
