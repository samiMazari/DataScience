# Web Scraping — Definition for Data Scientists

## **What is Web Scraping?**

**Web scraping** is the automated process of extracting structured data from websites.  
For data scientists, it is a powerful technique used to collect real-world data — such as product prices, news articles, financial indicators, or user reviews — when no API is available.



## **Why Do Data Scientists Use Web Scraping?**

Web scraping enables data scientists to:

- Build custom datasets for analysis or machine learning models  
- Monitor trends or market movements  
- Enrich existing datasets with real-time web data  



## **How Does It Work?**

It typically involves:

1. **Sending requests** to a web page  
2. **Parsing the HTML** content (with tools like `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium`)  
3. **Extracting specific information** (like text, tables, or metadata)  
4. **Saving the data** in usable formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON)



> ⚠️ Note: Always check a website’s `robots.txt` and terms of use before scraping. Ethical and legal considerations matter.
