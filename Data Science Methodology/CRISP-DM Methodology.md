# CRISP-DM Methodology: 

## 1. Business Understanding
**Focus :** Understanding the project goals from a business perspective.

**Key Activities :**
Define the business problem or objective (e.g., "Reduce customer churn").

Identify success criteria (e.g., "Predict churn with 80% accuracy").

Assess risks, constraints, and resources.

**Output :**
Project charter or problem statement.

Business goals translated into data science goals.

## 2. Data Understanding
Focus: Collecting and familiarizing with the data.

**Key Activities :**
Initial data collection from sources (databases, APIs, Excel, etc.).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): stats, visualizations, distributions.

Identify data quality issues (missing, duplicates, outliers).

Form initial hypotheses.

**Output :**
Data dictionary

Data quality report

Initial EDA summary

## 3.  Data Preparation (Often the most time-consuming step)
Focus: Transforming raw data into a usable form for modeling.

**Key Activities :**
Cleaning (handle missing values, remove duplicates).

Feature engineering (create new variables).

Data transformation (scaling, encoding, normalization).

Data integration (merging multiple sources).

Splitting data into training/test sets.

**Output :**
Cleaned and transformed dataset ready for modeling.

## 4. Modeling           
Focus: Building and training machine learning models.

**Key Activities :**
Choose modeling techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).

Select features for modeling.

Train multiple models with different parameters.

Evaluate models using validation data.

**Output :**
Trained models with performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, RMSE).

Model comparison chart.

## 5.  Evaluation
Focus: Ensuring the model meets business goals before deployment.

**Key Activities :**
Review evaluation metrics in business context.

Perform error analysis (why did the model make certain predictions?).

**Decide :** Is the model good enough? Should we iterate?

**Output :**
Evaluation report

Go/No-Go decision on deployment

## 6.  Deployment
Focus: Delivering the final model into production or business use.

**Key Activities :**
Deploy the model in a live environment (API, dashboard, app, etc.).

Develop monitoring tools (track performance over time).

Create documentation for end users.

Train stakeholders or build reporting interfaces.

**Output :**
Production-ready solution

Final report and model documentation

Plan for ongoing monitoring and maintenance
