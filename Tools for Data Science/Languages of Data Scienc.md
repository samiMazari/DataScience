# Introduction :    
For users who are just starting on their data science journey, the range of available technical options can be overwhelming. There are literally thousands of different programming languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. So, **which language should you learn first?**       
*The answer to that question depends largely on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and who you are solving them for. First and foremost, we recommend considering the Python, R, and SQL languages.*            
The problems can be related to the company you work for, what role you have, and the age of your existing application. So, what problems do you need to solve?
