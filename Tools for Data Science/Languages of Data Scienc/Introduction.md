# Introduction :    
For users who are just starting on their data science journey, the range of available technical options can be overwhelming. There are literally thousands of different programming languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. So, **which language should you learn first?** 

*The answer to that question depends largely on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and who you are solving them for. First and foremost, we recommend considering the Python, R, and SQL languages.*     

The problems can be related to the company you work for, what role you have, and the age of your existing application. So, what problems do you need to solve?
There are many roles available for people who are interested in getting involved in data science, and they include: 
- Business Analyst
- Database Engineer
- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Research Scientist
- Software Engineer
- Statistician
- Product Manager
- Project Manager


# Summary 
- You should select a language to learn depending on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and whom you are solving them for.

- The popular languages are Python, R, SQL, Scala, Java, C++, and Julia.

- For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. 

- Python can also be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). 

- Python is open source, and R is free software. 

- R languageâ€™s array-oriented syntax makes it easier to translate from math to code for learners with no or minimal programming background.

- SQL is different from other software development languages because it is a non-procedural language.

- SQL was designed for managing data in relational databases. 

- If you learn SQL and use it with one database, you can apply your SQL knowledge with many other databases easily.

- Data science tools built with Java include Weka, Java-ML, Apache MLlib, and Deeplearning4.

- For data science, popular program built with Scala is Apache Spark which includes Shark, MLlib, GraphX, and Spark Streaming.

- Programs built for Data Science with JavaScript include TensorFlow.js and R-js.

- One great application of Julia for Data Science is JuliaDB.
