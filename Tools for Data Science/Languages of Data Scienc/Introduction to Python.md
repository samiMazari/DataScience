# More About Python :    

- Python conditions use `if` statements to execute code based on true/false conditions created by comparisons and Boolean expressions.

- Comparison operations require using comparison operators such as `==` (equal to), `>` (greater than), and `<` (less than).

- Python uses the `!=` operator to determine whether two values are not equal.

- You can compare integers, strings, and floats.

- Python branching directs program flow by using conditional statements (for example, `if`, `else`, `elif`) to execute different code blocks based on conditions or tests.

- You can use the `if` statement with conditions to define actions if true.

- To perform actions when all previous conditions are false, you can use the `else` statement without a condition.

- The `elif` statement allows for additional checks only if the initial condition is false.

- To execute various operations on Boolean values, we use Boolean logic operators.

- Python loops are control structures that automate repetitive tasks and iterate over data structures like lists or dictionaries.

- The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers with a specified start, stop, and step value for loops in Python.

- A `for` loop in Python iterates over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string, and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

- A `while` loop in Python executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

- Python functions are reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks, take input parameters, and often return results, enhancing code modularity and reusability.

- You may or may not have written the codes that are often included in functions.

- Python has a set of built-in functions such as `len` to find the length of a sequence or `sum` to find the total sum of a sequence.

- The `sorted` function creates a new sorted list, while `sort` sorts items in the original list.

- You can also create your own functions in Python.

- To ensure clarity and organization and facilitate understanding and maintenance of the code, developers must document functions using a documentation string enclosed in three quotes.

- The `help` command will return the documentation defined for a particular function.

- A function can have multiple parameters.

- If a function does not include a `return` statement, it returns `None` by default.

- You can use the `pass` keyword in a function to indicate that it does nothing (a placeholder for future code).

- A function will usually perform more than one task.

- In Python, the scope of a variable determines where you can access or modify that variable. Global scope allows access from anywhere, while local scope restricts it to a block or function.

- In Python, a programmer defines a local variable within a specific block or function, which can only be accessed or modified within that block or function.

- In Python, a global variable is a variable defined at the top level of a program that any part of the code can access or modify.

- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing and responding to errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution, preventing them from crashing the program.

- In Python, you use the `try-except` statement to attempt a block of code and specify alternative actions to execute if an error occurs, allowing you to handle exceptions.

- In Python, you use the `try-except-else` statement to attempt a block of code, handle exceptions in the `except` block, and execute code in the `else` block when no exceptions occur.

- Python developers use the `try-except-else-finally` statement to attempt a block of code, catch exceptions in the `except` block, execute code in the `else` block when no exceptions occur, and ensure that the `finally` block always runs, regardless of whether exception was raised or not.

- In Python, objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior, serving as the foundation for creating and working with various data types and custom data structures.

- To determine the type of an object in Python, you can use the `type()` command.

- Methods may modify an objectâ€™s internal state, but the objectâ€™s type usually remains the same.

- Classes in Python are blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods, enabling code organization, and object-oriented programming.

- Function `__init__` is a special method used to initialize data attributes.

- We can create instances of a class in Python.

- Data attributes consist of the data defining the objects.

- Methods are functions that interact and change the data attributes.

- The method has a function that requires the `self` as well as other parameters.
