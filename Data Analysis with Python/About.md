- In this Data Analysis With Python :                                                                    
     - you will learn to use the most important libraries for analyzing data in Python, including NumPy, Pandas, and Klearn.                                                        
     - Python libraries are integral to becoming a data scientist and used in industries such as healthcare, finance, insurance, all things Internet, and many others.   
     - you will learn how to analyzing data, you'll learn how to build data pipelines and build your own machine learning model for making predictions on real world data set.
