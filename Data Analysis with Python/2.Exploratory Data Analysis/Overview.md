# Chi-Square Test for Categorical Variables : 
### Introduction
The chi-square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. This test is widely used in various fields, including social sciences, marketing, and healthcare, to analyze survey data, experimental results, and observational studies.

### Concept
The chi-square test is a non-parametric statistical method that evaluates whether the observed frequencies in each category differ significantly from the expected frequencies—assuming no association between the variables.

The test is based on the chi-square distribution, which is a family of distributions defined by degrees of freedom (df). These distributions are right-skewed and vary depending on df. A chi-square distribution table lists critical values for given df and significance levels (α), which we use to assess if our computed test statistic is extreme enough to reject the null hypothesis.

#### Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis
The chi-square test involves formulating two hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis `H0`
