At the end of the day, for businesses, they know one thing, that if they are unable to measure something, they are unable to improve it. And if they are unable to measure their costs, they are unable to reduce them. If they're unable to measure their profits, they are unable to increase them. So the first thing a company has to do is to start recording information, start capturing data, data about costs. And the differentiate it by labor costs and material cost, the cost to how much it cost to sell one product and the total cost , heres come **DataScience**
