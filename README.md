| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **AI** | Artificial Intelligence – The broad science of making machines "intelligent" or capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence. |
| **ML** | Machine Learning – A subset of AI that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions. |
| **DL** | Deep Learning – A subfield of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. |
| **DS** | Data Science – A multidisciplinary field combining statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data. |
| **EDA** | Exploratory Data Analysis – The process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics. |
| **NLP** | Natural Language Processing – A field focused on the interaction between computers and human language. |
| **Supervised Learning** | ML tasks where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs). |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | ML tasks where the model identifies patterns in data without labeled outputs. |
| **Overfitting** | When a model learns noise in the training data, reducing its generalization performance. |
